            <p>I wanted to take this opportunity of making my portfolio to use some tools. Some of them are familiar to me like <b>Docker</b> and others are new like <b>Brunch</b>.</p>
            <p>This portfolio is using <b>Silex</b> as a micro-PHP framework. It's useful for small project because I can handle every component I need instead of implementing directly something bigger like Symfony2.</p>
            <p>I wanted to give a try to <b>Caddy</b> server instead of using Nginx. It's a single file server binary with a conf file. Very easy to use and straightforward, perfect for small projects.</p>
            <p><b>Brunch</b> is a tool I use to compile/optimize assets (a gulp-like). Never tried before, but nothing difficult here.</p>
            <p>Everything is <b>Docker</b>ized to be able to deploy every change easily on my server.<br>I can manage a dev environment and a production one simply by playing with docker-compose.yml.</p>
            <p>With the help of Docker, docker-compose and Caddy it's now easy for my to add a new project with a new domain on my server beside this portfolio.</p>
